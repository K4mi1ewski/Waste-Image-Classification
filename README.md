Initial steps
- TrashNet dataset needs to be Pushed into your Google Drive 
- Run existing file - CudaProject.ipynb (Google Colab)
- Upon running the code in CudaProject.ipynb, a new file named 'simpleCnn.h5' will be generated. This file presumably contains the trained model weights and architecture.
- Run GUI and choose your photo to be classified
