##Files
GUI.py
This script is responsible for the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the project. It handles all the user interactions and visual components.
### Usage Guide

# Image Classifier GUI

This guide provides instructions on how to use the Image Classifier GUI to classify images into predefined categories using a pre-trained CNN model.

## Steps to Use

1. **Run the Script**
    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory containing the `GUI.py` script.
    - Run the script using the following command:
      ```bash
      python GUI.py
      ```

2. **Open the GUI**
    - After running the script, a GUI window titled "Image Classifier" will appear.

3. **Select an Image**
    - In the GUI, click the button labeled "Classify Image".
    - A file dialog will open, allowing you to browse and select an image file from your computer.

4. **Classify the Image**
    - Once you select an image, the script will process it and classify it into one of the predefined categories.
    - A message box will pop up displaying the predicted class of the image.
